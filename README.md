Elevating face recognition technology with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **face_recognition** to seamlessly integrate **real-time detection** and recognition capabilities with your webcam.

---

## üåü Overview

This repository provides an extensible, user-friendly **Face Recognition** solution. Combining **OpenCV** for webcam integration and **face_recognition** for accurate facial recognition, the program detects and identifies faces on-the-fly.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üé• **Real-Time Recognition:** Detect and recognize faces in real-time through your webcam.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Effortless Setup:** Seamless integration with minimal configuration.
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Multi-Face Recognition:** Easily customizable to recognize multiple known faces.

## üìä Pipeline Workflow

Our face recognition system follows a streamlined process:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Open Webcam]
    B --> C[Capture Video Frame]
    C --> D[Detect Face Locations]
    D --> E[Extract Face Encodings]
    E --> F{Face Match?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Identify Known Person]
    F -->|No| H[Label as Unknown]
    G --> I[Draw Rectangle]
    H --> I[Draw Rectangle]
    I --> J[Display Frame]
    J --> K{User Quits?}
    K -->|No| C
    K -->|Yes| L[Close Webcam]
    L --> M[End]
```

This diagram illustrates the key steps in our face recognition process:
- Open the webcam and begin video capture
- Detect face locations in each frame
- Extract face encodings
- Compare against known faces
- Identify or label faces
- Continuously update and display results
