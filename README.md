This repository houses a Python-based face recognition program that utilizes OpenCV and the face_recognition library to perform real-time detection and recognition of faces using a webcam. 

## Overview

The project aims to provide a user-friendly and easily extensible face recognition solution. It leverages the capabilities of OpenCV for webcam integration and the face_recognition library for accurate face detection and recognition tasks. 

## Features

- **Real-time face detection and recognition:** The program can identify and recognize faces in real-time as they appear in the webcam feed.
- **Simplified setup and webcam integration:** The project is designed for easy setup and seamless integration with a webcam, requiring minimal user configuration.
- **Customizable for multiple known faces:** The ability to add and recognize multiple known faces is easily achievable through simple customization within the script.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Python:** Install the latest version of Python from the [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **OpenCV:** Install OpenCV using the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
- **face_recognition library:** Install the face_recognition library using the following command:
```bash
pip install face_recognition
```

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/niladrridas/facerecognition.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd facerecognition
```

3. **Run the script:**
```bash
python face_recognition_webcam.py
```

4. **Use the webcam:** Point the webcam towards the desired area and the program will start detecting and recognizing faces in real-time.

## Configuration

- **Customization of known faces:** Replace the existing image file in the script with images of the desired faces for recognition. 
- **Additional features and configurations:** Explore the script for advanced usage options, including the ability to adjust parameters and settings.
