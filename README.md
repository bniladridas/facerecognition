# Face Recognition Webcam

A Python-based face recognition program using OpenCV and the face_recognition library for real-time face detection and recognition with a webcam.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a simple and extensible face recognition solution. It utilizes the OpenCV library for webcam integration and the face_recognition library for face detection and recognition.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Simple setup and integration with a webcam.
- Easily customizable for multiple known faces.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition library

## Installation

1. Install Python: [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install required libraries:
   
   `pip install opencv-python`
